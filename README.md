❤️ Heart Attack Prediction with Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of a heart attack using machine learning models.  
It applies data preprocessing, multiple algorithms, and evaluation metrics to build an accurate prediction system.

📂 Project Structure
NOTE:
To run app.py, you first need to generate the .pkl model file using Heart_attack_prediction.ipynb. 
After running the notebook, the .pkl file will be created, and then you can run the model with app.py.

├── Heart_attack_prediction.ipynb # Jupyter notebook with full workflow
├── heart_attack_prediction_indonesia.csv # Dataset
└── (model files ignored from GitHub, use external storage)
